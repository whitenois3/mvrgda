Variable Rate Gradual Dutch Auctions with Martingale Price Correction.


### Why?

_NOTE: it is strongly recommended that you have read the [VRGDA White Paper](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda) before proceeding._

Variable Rate Gradual Dutch Auctions (VRGDAs) are a novel token issuance mechanism that excel at letting you sell tokens close to a custom schedule over time by raising prices when sales are ahead of schedule and lowering prices when sales are behind schedule.

But, while the price may be _lowered_ over time, it may always be floored at zero. Additionally - there is one more static variable that is considered fixed, but may be made dynamic. More on this later.

VRGDAs provide a pricing mechanism that decays with time, but doesn't offer the ability for pricing to become _negative_. [MVRGDAs](https://github.com/whitenois3/mvrgda) are a variant of VRGDAs that allow for negative prices. By using the current reserves, a `pushback` may be factored into the price. When the `currentPrice` is below the `targetPrice`, the `pushback` comes into effect and is essentially a fraction of the reflexive price (the current reserves divided by amount sold), where the fraction is the `targetPrice` less the `currentPrice`, over the `targetPrice`.

This formula is configurable as the current reserves is an overridable function `getCurrentReserves`.

### Example

Consider the following scenario:

You are issuing 672 gulags at an intended issuance of 1 gulag per hour for a total of one month - or precisely, 28 days (4 weeks).
