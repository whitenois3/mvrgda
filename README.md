Variable Rate Gradual Dutch Auctions with Martingale Correction.


### Why?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Idea: adjust VRGDA to produce negative prices.<br><br>That&#39;s right, pay the users to mint.<br><br>&quot;But why?&quot;<br><br>â†“</p>&mdash; WINTÎžR ðŸ’™ðŸ’› (@w1nt3r_eth) <a href="https://twitter.com/w1nt3r_eth/status/1568039897617014785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2022</a></blockquote>


Variable Rate Gradual Dutch Auctions are a novel token issuance mechanism that excel at letting you sell tokens close to a custom schedule over time by raising prices when sales are ahead of schedule and lowering prices when sales are behind schedule.

But, while the price may be _lowered_ over time, it may always be floored at zero. Additionally - there is one more static variable that is considered fixed, but may be made dynamic. More on this later.

Consider the following scenario:

You are issuing 672 gulags at an intended issuance of 1 gulag per hour for a total of one month - or precisely, 28 days (4 weeks).


// TODO: fix: supply may be infinite in VRGDAs
// TODO: key here is the variability in _sale price_




### What is this?

First, read the [VRGDA White Paper](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda).

// TODO: describe how this works
